    <H2 class="para">Spear Phishing: </H2>
    <p class = "para" >Spear Phishing is similar to standard fishing except targeted at and highly personalised towards a specific individual. 
      Like regular Phishing, emails, sms mesages or phone calls are made to look legitimate but unlike regular fishing contain a mesage meant specifically for the recipient.
      What makes spear Phishing is so succesful is that the attackers do research and preperation for their specific target.
      They can easily find information about the taget which makes social engineering much more effecticve and succesful.
